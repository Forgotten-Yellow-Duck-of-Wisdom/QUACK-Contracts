This array is designed with the following considerations:
- Level 1 starts at 100 XP.
- Levels 1-50 can be achieved within 1-3 months.
- Levels 50-60 can be achieved within another 1-3 months.
- Levels 60-100 are spread out over 5-8 years.

Now, the XP rewards for different activities to match the game lifecycle:
- Food eating / consumable: 10 XP
- Game wins:
Easy game: 20 XP
Medium game: 40 XP
Hard game: 60 XP
- Event participation: 100 XP
- Voting participation: 50 XP

Assuming a player performs the following activities daily:
Feeds 10 times: 10 10 = 100 XP
Wins 5 easy games, 3 medium games, and 1 hard game: (5 20) + (3 40) + (1 60) = 280 XP
Participates in 1 event per week: 100 / 7 ≈ 14 XP per day on average
Votes once per week: 50 / 7 ≈ 7 XP per day on average
Total daily XP: 100 + 280 + 14 + 7 = 401 XP

With this XP distribution:
Players can reach level 50 in about 43 days (≈ 1.5 months)
Players can reach level 60 in about 67 days (≈ 2.2 months)
Reaching level 100 would take about 1,160 days (≈ 3.2 years)
